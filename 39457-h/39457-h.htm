<h2><a name="BIOGRAPHICAL_NOTE" id="BIOGRAPHICAL_NOTE"></a>BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE</h2>
<p><br /></p>

<p>The author of the following pages, Karl Max, Prince
Lichnowsky, is a member of a family which holds estates
both in German and Austrian Silesia, and has an
hereditary seat in the Upper House of the Prussian
Diet. The father of the present Prince and his predecessor
in the title was a Prussian cavalry general, who,
at the end of his life, sat for some years in the Reichstag
as a member of the Free Conservative Party.</p>

<p>His uncle, Prince Felix, was elected in 1848 to represent
Ratibor in the German National Assembly at
Frankfort-on-Main; he was an active member of the
Conservative wing, and during the September rising,
while riding with General Auerswald in the neighbourhood
of the city, was attacked and murdered by the
mob.</p>

<p>The present Prince, after serving in the Prussian
army, in which he holds the rank of Major, entered the
diplomatic service. He was in 1885 for a short time attached
to the German Embassy in London, and afterwards
became Councillor of Embassy in Vienna. From
1899 to 1904 he was employed in the German Foreign
Office, and received the rank and title of Minister Plenipotentiary.</p>

<p>In 1904 he retired to his Silesian estates, and, as he
states, lived for eight years the life of a country gentleman,
but read industriously and published occasional
political articles. He himself recounts the circumstances
in which he was appointed Ambassador in London on
the death of Baron Marschall von Bieberstein.</p>

<p>Baron Marschall, who had been Secretary for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vi" id="Page_vi">[Pg vi]</a></span>
Foreign Affairs under the Chancellorships of Count Caprivi
and for a time under Prince Hohenlohe, had achieved
great success as Ambassador at Constantinople, and also,
from the German point of view, as chief German Plenipotentiary
at the Second Hague Conference in 1907.
Baron Marschall was, to use an expression of Bismarck's,
"the best horse in Germany's diplomatic stable." And
great things were expected of him in London. But he
lived only a few months after his appointment.</p>

<p>Prince Lichnowsky's high social rank, his agreeable
manners, and the generous hospitality which he showed
in Carlton House Terrace gave him a position in English
society which facilitated the negotiations between England
and Germany, and did much to diminish the friction
that had arisen during the time that Prince B&#252;low
held the post of German Chancellor.</p>

<p>The pamphlet which is here translated gives an account
of his London mission; after his return to Germany
he has lived in retirement in the country, but has contributed
occasional articles to the Press. The pamphlet,
which was written in August, 1916, was not intended
for publication, but was distributed confidentially to a
few friends. The existence of it had long been known,
but it was only in March of this year that for the first
time extracts from it were published in the Swedish
paper <i>Politiken</i>. Longer extracts have since appeared
in the London Press; for the first time a complete
translation made from the German original is now placed
before the public.</p>

<h2><a name="PREFACE" id="PREFACE"></a>PREFACE</h2>

<p><br /></p>

<p>Never perhaps in history has the world seen so great
an exhibition, as at the outbreak of this war, of the
murderous and corrupting power of the organised lie.
All Germany outside the governmental circles was induced
to believe that the war was a treacherous attack,
plotted in the dark by "revengeful France, barbaric
Russia, and envious England," against the innocent
and peace-loving Fatherland. And the centre of the
plot was the Machiavellian Grey, who for long years
had been encircling and strangling Germany in order
at the chosen moment to deal her a death-blow from
behind. The Emperor, the princes, the ministers, the
bishops and chaplains, the historians and theologians,
in part consciously and in part innocently, vied with
one another in solemn attestations and ingenious forgeries
of evidence; and the people, docile by training and long
indoctrinated to the hatred of England, inevitably believed
and passionately exaggerated what they were told.
From this belief, in large part, came the strange brutalities
and ferocities of the common people of Germany
at the opening of the war, whether towards persons
who had a right to courtesy, like the Ambassadors,
or a claim on common human sympathy, like the
wounded and the prisoners. The German masses could
show no mercy towards people guilty of so hideous a
world-crime.</p>

<p>And now comes evidence, which in normal times would
convince even the German nation, that the whole basis
of their belief was a structure of deliberate falsehood;
which shows that it was the Kaiser and his Ministers<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_viii" id="Page_viii">[Pg viii]</a></span>
who plotted the war; while it was England, and especially
Sir Edward Grey, who strove hardest for the
preservation of peace.</p>

<p>It is the evidence of the German Ambassador in London
during the years 1912-1914, Prince Lichnowsky,
corroborated rather than confuted by the comments of
Herr von Jagow, who was Foreign Minister at the
time, and carried further by the recently published Memoranda
of Herr M&#252;hlon, one of the directors of the
Krupp armament factory at Essen. One could hardly
imagine more convincing testimony. Will the German
people believe it? Would they believe now if one
rose from the dead?</p>

<p>We cannot yet guess at the answer. Indeed, there is
another question which must be answered first: For
what motive, and with what possible change of policy
in view, has the German Government permitted the
publication of these papers and the circulation of Lichnowsky's
Memorandum as a pamphlet at 30 pfennig?
Do the militarists think their triumph is safe, and the
time come for them to throw off the mask? Or have
the opponents of militarism, who seemed so crushed,
succeeded in asserting their power? Is it a plan to
induce the ever docile German populace to hate England
less?</p>

<p>It must be a startling story for the Germans, but for
us it contains little that is new. It is an absolute confirmation,
in spirit and in letter, of the British Blue Book
and of English books such as Mr. Headlam's "History
of Twelve Days" and Mr. Archer's "Thirteen Days."
Prince Lichnowsky's summing-up agrees exactly with
the British conclusions: The Germans encouraged Count
Berchtold to attack Serbia, well knowing the consequences
to expect; between the 23rd and 30th July they
rejected all forms of mediation; and on the 30th July,
when Austria wished to withdraw, they hastily sent an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ix" id="Page_ix">[Pg ix]</a></span>
ultimatum to Russia so as to make withdrawal impossible
(pp. 39-40). A ghastly story of blindness and
crime; but we knew it all before.</p>

<p>Equally interesting is Prince Lichnowsky's account
of the policy of Germany and England before the war.
He confirms our knowledge of the "sinister vagueness"
of German policy in Morocco, the steady desire of
England to come to an understanding and of Germany
to elude an understanding. As for our alleged envy of
German trade, it was in English commercial circles that
the desire for an understanding with Germany was
strongest. As for our "policy of encirclement," it was
the deliberate aim of our policy, continuing the line of
Lord Salisbury and Mr. Chamberlain, to facilitate rather
than hinder the legitimate and peaceful expansion of a
great force, which would become dangerous if suppressed
and confined.</p>

<p>The test cases were the Bagdad Railway and the Portuguese
Colonies. We agreed to make no objection to
Germany's buying them when Portugal was willing to
sell; we agreed in the meantime to treat them as a
German sphere of interest and not to compete for influence
there. We agreed, subject to the conservation
of existing British rights and to certain other safeguards,
to the completion of the great railway from the
Bosphorus to Basra, and to the recognition of the whole
district tapped by the railway as a German sphere of
interest. The two treaties, though completed, were never
signed; why? Because Grey would sign no secret treaty.
He insisted that they must be published. And the German
Government would not allow them to be published!
To Lichnowsky this seemed like mere spite on the part
of rivals who grudged his success, but we see now that
it was a deliberate policy. The war-makers could not
afford to let their people know the proof of England's
goodwill.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_x" id="Page_x">[Pg x]</a></span></p>

<p>Lichnowsky was a friend of England, but he was no
pacifist or "little German." His policy was to favour
the peaceful expansion of Germany, in good understanding
with England and France, on the seas and in the
colonies. He aimed at "imperial development" on British
lines; he abhorred the "Triple Alliance policy" of
espousing Austria's quarrels, backing Turkey against the
Balkan States, intriguing against Russia, and seeing all
politics in the terms of European rivalries with a background
of war. His own policy was one which, if followed
loyally by the German Government, would have
avoided the war and saved Europe.</p>

<p>There are one or two traits in Lichnowsky's language
which show that, with all his liberality of thought, he is
still a German. He accepts at once, on the report of a
German secret agent, the false statement that Grey had
concluded a secret treaty with France. He mentions,
as if it were a natural thing, the strange opinion that
the <i>Standard</i> was "apparently bought by Austria." He
describes Mr. Asquith as a pacifist and Sir Edward Grey
as both a pacifist and, ideally and practically, a Socialist.
One must remember the sort of views he was accustomed
to at Potsdam.</p>

<p>There can be no doubt that Lichnowsky was deliberately
deceived by his Government, and not much that
he was chosen for his post in London with a view to
deceiving us. These things are all in gospel according
to Bernhardi. Lichnowsky himself was both an honest
and an able diplomatist, and there is the ring of sincerity
in his words of self-reproach: "I had to support in
London a policy the heresy of which I recognised. That
brought down vengeance on me, for it was a sin against
the Holy Ghost."</p>

<p>If Grey, in the tangle of terrific problems that surrounded
him, ever erred, his sin was not against the
Holy Ghost. The attack made on him at the <a name="outset" id="outset">outset</a> of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xi" id="Page_xi">[Pg xi]</a></span>
the war by Radical idealists was easy to confute. If
ever a statesman strove, with due prudence, for peace,
for friendship between nations, for a transformation of
armed rivalries into cordial and democratic understandings,
our great English Minister was that man. He
was accused as a maker of secret treaties; and we find
him all through the times of peace, and through all times
when choice was still possible, a steady refuser of
secret treaties. He was accused as a seeker for territory;
and we find him, both in war and peace, steadily
opposing all territorial aggrandisement. Such was the
policy approved by the leaders of both English parties
before the war.</p>

<p>It is an attack from the other side that now reaches
him. If the war had been short and successful, this
would not have occurred. But a long and bitter and
dangerous war of necessity creates its own atmosphere,
and the policy that was wisdom in 1913, when the world
was at peace and our relations with Germany were improving,
strikes us now perhaps as strangely trustful
and generous. Yet, if we try to recover that mental
calm without which the nations will never till the end
of time be able to restore their wasted wealth and rebuild
the shattered hopes of civilisation, I think most
Englishmen will agree that Grey's policy was, as we
all thought it at the time, the right and the wise policy.
To let all the world know that we would never join in
any attack on Germany, but would never permit any
attack on France; to seek to remove all causes of friction
between England and Germany, as they had been
removed between England and France and between England
and Russia; to extend the "Entente Cordiale" by
gradual steps to all nations who would come into it, and
to "bring the two groups of Europe nearer." This
was the right policy, whether it succeeded or failed;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xii" id="Page_xii">[Pg xii]</a></span>
and it will, in spirit at least, some day be the right
policy again.</p>

<p>No Englishman, I think, will regret the generous courtesy
which sent off the German Ambassador with a guard
of honour, "like a departing sovereign." No one will regret
our Prime Minister's silent tears when the war became
inevitable, or Grey's conviction that it would be
"the greatest catastrophe in history"&mdash;not even if mad
German militarists drew the conclusion that the only
motive for such grief must be the fear of defeat. For
my own part I am glad that, at the last interview with
Lichnowsky, Grey assured him that, if ever a chance
came of mediation between the combatants, he would
take it, and that "we have never wished to crush Germany."</p>

<p>Surely, even now in the crisis of the war, it is well
to remember these things. The cleaner our national conscience
the keener surely will be our will to victory. The
slower we were to give up the traditions of generosity
and trustfulness that came from our long security the
firmer will be our resolution to hold out, through whatever
martyrdom may be yet in store for us, until we or
our children can afford once more to live generously and
to trust our neighbours. In the long run no other life
is worth living.</p>

<h1>MY MISSION TO LONDON<br />

<small>1912-14</small></h1>

<h4><a name="My_Appointment" id="My_Appointment"></a><span class="smcap">My Appointment</span></h4>

<p>In September, 1912, Baron Marschall died after he had
only been at his post in London for a few months. His
appointment, which no doubt was principally due to his
age and the desire of his junior officer to go to London,
was one of the many mistakes of our policy.</p>

<p>In spite of his striking personality and great reputation,
he was too old and too tired to adjust himself to
the Anglo-Saxon world, which was completely alien to
him; he was rather an official and a lawyer than a
diplomat and statesman. From the very beginning he
was at great pains to convince the English of the harmlessness
of our fleet, and naturally this only produced
the contrary effect.</p>

<p>Much to my surprise, I was offered the post in October.
I had retired to the country as a "Personalreferent"
after many years of activity, there being then no suitable
post available for me. I passed my time between flax
and turnips, among horses and meadows, read extensively,
and occasionally published political essays.</p>

<p>Thus I had spent eight years, and it was thirteen
since I had left the Embassy at Vienna with the rank
of Envoy. That had been my last real sphere of political
activity, as in those days such activity was impossible
unless one was prepared to help a half-crazy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[Pg 2]</a></span>
chief in drafting his crotchety orders with their crabbed
instructions.</p>

<p>I do not know who was responsible for my being
appointed to London. It was certainly not due to H.M.
alone&mdash;I was not one of his intimates, though he was
at all times gracious to me. I also know by experience
that his nominees generally met with successful
opposition. Herr von Kiderlen had really wanted to
send Herr von Stumm to London! He immediately
manifested unmistakable ill-will towards me, and endeavoured
to intimidate me by his incivility. Herr von
Bethmann Hollweg was at that time kindly disposed
towards me, and had paid me a visit at Gr&#228;tz only a
short time before. I am therefore inclined to think
that they all agreed on me because no other candidate
was available at the moment. But for Baron Marschall's
unexpected death, I should no more have been called
out of retirement then than at any other time during
all those previous years.</p>

<p><br /></p>

<h4><a name="Morocco_Policy" id="Morocco_Policy"></a><span class="smcap">Morocco Policy</span></h4>

<p>It was certainly the right moment for a new effort to
establish better relations with England. Our enigmatic
Morocco policy had repeatedly shaken confidence in our
pacific intentions. At the very least, it had given rise
to the suspicion that we did not quite know what we
wanted, or that it was our object to keep Europe on
the <i>qui vive</i>, and, when opportunity offered, to humiliate
France. An Austrian colleague, who had been in Paris
for a long time, said to me: "Whenever the French
begin to forget about <i>revanche</i>, you always remind them
of it with a jack-boot."</p>

<p>After we had repulsed M. Delcass&#233;'s efforts to arrive
at an understanding with us about Morocco, and prior
to that had formally declared that we had no political<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[Pg 3]</a></span>
interests there&mdash;which conformed to the traditions of
the Bismarckian policy&mdash;we suddenly discovered a second
Kr&#252;ger in Abdul Aziz. We assured him also, like
the Boers, of the protection of the mighty German
Empire, with the same display and the same result;
both demonstrations terminated with our retreat, as
they were bound to do, if we had not already made up
our minds to embark on the world-war. The distressing
congress at Alge&#231;iras could not change this in any way,
still less the fall of M. Delcass&#233;.</p>

<p>Our attitude promoted the Russo-Japanese and later
the Anglo-Japanese <i>rapprochement</i>. In face of "the German
Peril" all other differences faded into the background.
The possibility of a new Franco-German war
had become apparent, and such a war could not, as in
1870, leave either Russia or England unaffected.</p>

<p>The uselessness of the Triple Alliance had been shown
at Alge&#231;iras, while that of the agreements arrived at
there was demonstrated shortly afterwards by the collapse
of the Sultanate, which, of course, could not be
prevented. Among the German people, however, the belief
gained ground that our foreign policy was feeble
and was giving way before the "Encirclement"&mdash;that
high-sounding phrases were succeeded by pusillanimous
surrender.</p>

<p>It is to the credit of Herr von Kiderlen, who is
otherwise overrated as a statesman, that he wound up
our Moroccan inheritance and accepted as they were
the facts that could no longer be altered. Whether,
indeed, it was necessary to alarm the world by the
Agadir incident I will leave others to say. It was jubilantly
acclaimed in Germany, but it had caused all the
more disquiet in England because the Government were
kept waiting for three weeks for an explanation of
our intentions. Lloyd George's speech, which was meant
as a warning to us, was the consequence. Before<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</a></span>
Delcass&#233;'s fall, and before Alge&#231;iras, we might have had a
harbour and territory on the West Coast, but after
those events it was impossible.</p>

<p><br /></p>

<h4><a name="Sir_Edward_Greys_Programme" id="Sir_Edward_Greys_Programme"></a><span class="smcap">Sir Edward Grey's Programme</span></h4>

<p>When I came to London in November, 1912, the excitement
over Morocco had subsided, as an agreement
with France had been reached in Berlin. It is true
that Haldane's mission had failed, as we had required
the assurance of neutrality, instead of being content
with a treaty securing us against British attacks and
attacks with British support. Yet Sir Edward Grey
had not relinquished the idea of arriving at an agreement
with us, and in the first place tried to do this in
colonial and economic questions. Conversations were
in progress with the capable and business-like Envoy
von K&#252;hlmann concerning the renewal of the Portuguese
colonial agreement and Mesopotamia (<a name="Bagdad_Railway" id="Bagdad_Railway">Bagdad Railway</a>),
the unavowed object of which was to divide both the
colonies and Asia Minor into spheres of influence.</p>

<p>The British statesman, after having settled all outstanding
points of difference with France and Russia,
wished to make similar agreements with us. It was not
his object to isolate us, but to the best of his power
to make us partners in the existing association. As
he had succeeded in overcoming Anglo-French and Anglo-Russian
differences, so he also wished to do his
best to eliminate the Anglo-German, and by a network
of treaties, which would in the end no doubt have led
to an agreement about the troublesome question of naval
armaments, to ensure the peace of the world, after our
previous policy had led to an association&mdash;the Entente&mdash;which
represented a mutual insurance against the risk
of war.</p>

<p>This was Sir E. Grey's plan. In his own words: Without<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</a></span>
interfering with our existing friendship with France
and Russia, which has no aggressive aims and does not
entail any binding obligations on England, to arrive at
a friendly <i>rapprochement</i> and understanding with Germany,
"to bring the two groups nearer."</p>

<p>As with us, there were two parties in England at that
time&mdash;the Optimists, who believed in an understanding,
and the Pessimists, who thought that sooner or later war
was inevitable.</p>

<p>The former embraced Messrs. Asquith, Grey, Lord
Haldane, and most of the Ministers in the Radical Cabinet;
also the leading Liberal papers, such as the <i>Westminster
Gazette</i>, <i>Manchester Guardian</i>, <i>Daily Chronicle</i>.
The Pessimists were mainly Conservative politicians like
Mr. Balfour, who repeatedly made this clear to me;
also leading Army men, like Lord Roberts, who pointed
out the necessity of universal military service ("The
Writing on the Wall"); further, the Northcliffe Press
and the eminent English journalist Mr. Garvin, of <i>The
Observer</i>. During my period of office, however, they
abstained from all attacks, and maintained both personally
and politically a friendly attitude. But our naval
policy and our attitude in 1905, 1908, and 1911 had
aroused in them the conviction that after all it would
some day come to war. Just as it is with us, the former
are now being accused in England of short-sightedness
and simplicity, whereas the latter are looked on as the
true prophets.</p>

<p><br /></p>

<h4><a name="The_Albanian_Question" id="The_Albanian_Question"></a><span class="smcap">The Albanian Question</span></h4>

<p>The first Balkan War had led to the collapse of Turkey
and thus to a defeat for our policy, which had been
identified with Turkey for a number of years. Since
Turkey in Europe could no longer be saved, there were
two ways in which we could deal with the inheritance:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span>
either we could declare our complete disinterestedness
with regard to the frontier delimitations and leave the
Balkan Powers to settle them, or we could support our
"Allies" and carry on a Triple Alliance policy in the
Near East, thus giving up the r&#244;le of mediator.</p>

<p>From the very beginning I advocated the former
course, but the Foreign Office emphatically favoured the
latter.</p>

<p>The vital point was the Albanian question. Our Allies
desired the establishment of an independent Albanian
state, as the Austrians did not want the Serbs to obtain
access to the Adriatic, and the Italians did not want the
Greeks to get to Valona or even to the north of Corfu.
As opposed to this, Russia, as is known, was backing
Serbia's wishes and France those of Greece.</p>

<p>My advice was to treat this question as outside the
scope of the Alliance, and to support neither the Austrian
nor the Italian claims. Without our aid it would have
been impossible to set up an independent Albania, which,
as anyone could foresee, had no prospect of surviving;
Serbia would have extended to the sea, and the present
world-war would have been avoided. France and Italy
would have quarrelled over Greece, and if the Italians
had not wanted to fight France unaided they would have
been compelled to acquiesce in Greece's expansion to
the north of Durazzo. The greater part of Albania is
Hellenic. The towns in the south are entirely so; and
during the Conference of Ambassadors delegations from
principal towns arrived in London to obtain annexation
to Greece. Even in present-day Greece there are Albanian
elements and the so-called Greek national dress
is of Albanian origin. The inclusion of the Albanians,
who are principally Orthodox and Moslem, in the body
of the Greek state was therefore the best and most
natural solution, if you left Scutari and the north to
the Serbs and Montenegrins. For dynastic reasons H.M.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span>
was also in favour of this solution. When I supported
this view in a letter to the monarch I received agitated
reproaches from the Chancellor; he said that I had the
reputation of being "an opponent of Austria," and I was
to abstain from such interference and direct correspondence.</p>

<p><br /></p>

<h4><a name="The_Near_East" id="The_Near_East"></a><span class="smcap">The Near East and the Policy of the Triple Alliance</span></h4>

<p>We ought at last to have broken with the fatal tradition
of pursuing a Triple Alliance policy in the Near East
also, and have recognised our mistake, which lay in identifying
ourselves in the south with the Turks and in the
north with the Austro-Magyars. For the continuance of
this policy, upon which we had entered at the Berlin
Congress, and which we had actively pursued ever since,
was bound to lead in time to a conflict with Russia and
to the world-war, more especially if the requisite cleverness
were lacking in high places. Instead of coming
to terms with Russia on a basis of the independence of
the Sultan, whom even Petrograd did not wish to eject
from Constantinople, and of confining ourselves to our
economic interests in the Near East and to the partitioning
of Asia Minor into spheres of influence while renouncing
any intention of military or political interference,
it was our political ambition to dominate on the
Bosphorus. In Russia they began to think that the road
to Constantinople and the Mediterranean lay <i>via</i> Berlin.
Instead of supporting the active development of the Balkan
States&mdash;which, once liberated, are anything rather
than Russian, and with which our experiences had been
very satisfactory&mdash;we took sides with the Turkish and
Magyar oppressors.</p>

<p>The fatal mistake of our Triple Alliance and Near
East policy&mdash;which had forced Russia, our natural best<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span>
friend and neighbour, into the arms of France and England
and away from its policy of Asiatic expansion&mdash;was
the more apparent, as a Franco-Russian attack,
which was the <i>sole</i> hypothesis that justified a Triple
Alliance policy, could be left out of our calculations.</p>

<p>The value of the Italian alliance needs no further reference.
Italy will want our money and our tourists even
after the war, with or without an alliance. That this
latter would fail us in case of war was patent beforehand.
Hence the alliance had <i>no value</i>. Austria needs
our protection in war, as in peace, and has no other support.
Her dependence on us is based on political, national,
and economic considerations, and is the greater
the more intimate our relations with Russia are. The
Bosnian crisis taught us this. Since the days of Count
Beust no Vienna Minister has adopted such a self-confident
attitude towards us as Count Aehrenthal during
the later years of his life. If German policy is conducted
on right lines, cultivating relations with Russia,
Austria-Hungary is our vassal and dependent on us,
even without an alliance or recompense; if it is wrongly
conducted, then we are dependent on Austria. Hence
there was <i>no reason</i> for the alliance.</p>

<p>I knew Austria too well not to be aware that a return
to the policy of Prince Felix Schwarzenberg or Count
Moritz Esterhazy was inconceivable there. Little as the
Slavs there love us, just as little do they wish to return
into a German Empire even with a Habsburg-Lorraine
emperor at its head. They are striving for a federation
in Austria on national lines, a state of things which
would have even less chance of being realised within the
German Empire than under the Double Eagle. The Germans
of Austria, however, acknowledge Berlin as the
centre of German Might and Culture, and are well aware
that Austria can never again be the leading Power.
They wish for as intimate a connection with the German<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span>
Empire as possible, not for an anti-German policy.</p>

<p>Since the 'seventies the position has fundamentally
changed in Austria, as in Bavaria. As, in the latter, a
return to Great German separatism and old Bavarian
policy is not to be feared, so with the former a resuscitation
of the policy of Prince Kaunitz and Schwarzenberg
was not to be expected. By a federation with Austria,
however, which resembles a big Belgium, since its
population, even without Galicia and Dalmatia, is only
about half Germanic, our interests would suffer as
much as if we subordinated our policy to the views of
Vienna or Budapest&mdash;thus espousing Austria's quarrels
("<i>d'&#233;pouser les querelles d'Autriche</i>").</p>

<p>Hence we were not obliged to take any notice of the
desires of our ally; they were not only unnecessary but
also dangerous, as they would lead to a conflict with
Russia if we looked at Oriental questions through Austrian
spectacles.</p>

<p>The development of the alliance, from a union formed
on a single hypothesis for a single specific purpose, into
a general and unlimited association, a pooling of interests
in all spheres, was the best way of producing that
which diplomacy was designed to prevent&mdash;war. Such
an "alliance policy" was also calculated to alienate from
us the sympathies of the strong, young, rising communities
in the Balkans, who were prepared to turn to us
and to open their markets to us.</p>

<p>The difference between the power of a Ruling House
and a National State, between dynastic and democratic
ideas of government, had to be decided, and as usual
we were on the wrong side.</p>

<p>King Carol told one of our representatives that he had
entered into the alliance with us on the assumption that
we retained the leadership; but if this passed to Austria,
that would alter the foundations of the relationship, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span>
under such circumstances he would not be able to go on
with it.</p>

<p>Things were similar in Serbia, where, contrary to our
own economic interests, we were supporting the Austrian
policy of strangulation.</p>

<p>Every time we have backed the wrong horse, whose
breakdown could have been foreseen: Kr&#252;ger, Abdul
Aziz, Abdul Hamid, Wilhelm of Wied, ending&mdash;the most
fatal of all mistakes&mdash;with the great plunge on the Berchtold
stable.</p>

<p><br /></p>

<h4><a name="The_Conference_of_Ambassadors" id="The_Conference_of_Ambassadors"></a><span class="smcap">The Conference of Ambassadors</span></h4>

<p>Shortly after my arrival in London, at the end of 1912,
Sir E. Grey proposed an informal conversation to prevent
the Balkan War developing into a European one,
after we had unfortunately refused, on the outbreak
of the war, to agree to the French proposal of a declaration
of disinterestedness. The British statesman
from the very beginning took up the position that England
had no interest in Albania, and had no intention
of going to war over this question. He merely wished
to mediate between the two groups as an "honest broker"
and smooth over difficulties. He therefore by no means
took sides with the Entente, and during the eight months
or so of the negotiations his goodwill and his authoritative
influence contributed in no small degree to the
attainment of an agreement. We, instead of adopting
an attitude similar to the English one, invariably took
up the position which was prescribed for us by Vienna.
Count Mensdorff was the leader of the Triple Alliance
in London; I was his "second." It was my duty to
support his proposals. That clever and experienced man
Count Sz&#246;gyenyi was conducting affairs in Berlin. His
refrain was "Then the <i>casus f&#339;deris</i> will arise," and
when I once ventured to doubt the truth of this conclusion<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span>
I was severely reprimanded for "Austrophobia."
It was also said that I had an "hereditary weakness"&mdash;the
allusion being to my father.</p>

<p>On all questions we took sides with Austria and Italy&mdash;about
Albania, a Serbian port on the Adriatic, Scutari,
and also about the delimitation of the frontiers of
Albania&mdash;while Sir E. Grey hardly ever supported the
French or Russian claims. He mostly supported our
group in order not to give a pretext like the one a dead
Archduke was to furnish later on. Thus with his assistance
it was possible to coax King Nikita out of
Scutari again. Otherwise this question would already
have led to a world-war, as we should certainly not have
ventured to induce "our ally" to give way.</p>

<p>Sir E. Grey conducted the negotiations with circumspection,
calm, and tact. When a question threatened to
become involved, he sketched a formula for agreement
which was to the point and was always accepted. His
personality inspired equal confidence in all the participants.</p>

<p>As a matter of fact we had again successfully emerged
from one of those trials of strength which characterise
our policy. Russia had been obliged to give way to us
on all points, as she was never in a position to procure
success for the Serbian aims. Albania was established
as a vassal state of Austria and Serbia was pressed
back from the sea. Hence this conference resulted in a
fresh humiliation for Russian self-esteem. As in 1878
and in 1908, we had opposed the Russian plans although
no <i>German</i> interests were involved. Bismarck was clever
enough to mitigate the mistake of the Congress by the
secret treaty and by his attitude in the Battenberg question;
but we continued to pursue in London the dangerous
path, upon which we had once more entered in the
Bosnian question, nor did we leave it in time when it led
to the precipice.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span></p>

<p>The ill-humour which prevailed in Russia at that time
was shown during the conference by attacks in the Russian
Press against my Russian colleague and Russian
diplomacy. The dissatisfied circles made capital of his
German descent and Roman Catholicism, his reputation
as a friend of Germany, and the accident that he was
related both to Count Mensdorff and to me. Without
possessing a very distinguished personality, Count Benckendorff
is endowed with a number of qualifications that
distinguish a good diplomat&mdash;tact, polished manners, experience,
courtesy, and a natural eye for men and matters.
He was always at pains to avoid a brusque attitude,
and was supported in this by England and France.</p>

<p>Later I once remarked to him: "I presume that Russian
feeling is very anti-German." He replied: "There
are also very strong and influential pro-German circles,
but in general people are anti-Austrian."</p>

<p>It is hardly necessary to add that our "Austrophilie &#224;
outrance" (friendship for Austria through thick and
thin) was hardly calculated to loosen the Entente and to
direct Russia towards her Asiatic interests!</p>

<p><br /></p>

<h4><a name="The_Balkan_Conference" id="The_Balkan_Conference"></a><span class="smcap">The Balkan Conference</span></h4>

<p>At the same time the Balkan Conference was sitting
in London and I had occasion to come into contact with
the leaders of the Balkan States. M. Venizelos was certainly
the most distinguished personality. At that time
he was anything rather than anti-German, and visited
me several times; he was especially fond of wearing the
ribbon of the Order of the Red Eagle&mdash;he even wore it
at the French Embassy. His prepossessing charm and
ways of a man of the world secured him much sympathy.
Next to him M. Daneff, at that time Bulgarian Premier
and confidant of Count Berchtold, played a great part.
He gave the impression of a subtle and energetic man,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span>
and it is probably only due to the influence of his Vienna
and Budapest friends, of whose homage he often made
fun, that he was induced to commit the folly of entering
upon the second Balkan War and of refusing Russian
arbitration.</p>

<p>M. Take Jonescu was also frequently in London and
then visited me regularly. I knew him from the time
when I was Secretary at Bucharest. He was also one
of Herr von Kiderlen's friends. In London he was
endeavouring to obtain concessions to Rumania from
M. Daneff by means of negotiations, in which he was
assisted by the very able Rumanian Ambassador Misu.
It is known that Bulgarian opposition brought about
the failure of these negotiations. Count Berchtold (and
we of course with him) was entirely on Bulgaria's side,
otherwise by putting pressure on M. Daneff we might
have secured the desired satisfaction for Rumania and
placed her under an obligation to us; she was finally
estranged from the Central Powers by Austria's attitude
during and after the second Balkan War.</p>

<p><br /></p>

<h4><a name="The_Second_Balkan_War" id="The_Second_Balkan_War"></a><span class="smcap">The Second Balkan War</span></h4>

<p>The defeat of Bulgaria in the second Balkan War
and the victory of Serbia, with the Rumanian invasion,
naturally constituted a humiliation for Austria. The
plan to rectify this by an expedition against Serbia
seems to have been evolved in Vienna soon after. The
Italian revelations prove this, and it may be assumed
that Marquis San Giuliano, who described the plan&mdash;most
aptly&mdash;as a <i>pericolosissima aventura</i>, saved us from being
involved in a world-war as early as the summer of 1913.</p>

<p>Owing to the intimacy of Russo-Italian relations, the
Vienna plan was doubtless known in Petrograd. In
any case, M. Sazonow openly declared at Constanza,
as M. Take Jonescu told me, that an Austrian attack on
Serbia would be a <i>casus belli</i> for Russia.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span></p>

<p>When one of my staff returned from leave in Vienna
in the spring of 1914 he said that Herr von Tschirschky
had declared that there would soon be war. As I, however,
was always left in ignorance about important events
I considered this pessimism to be unfounded.</p>

<p>As a matter of fact it would appear that, ever since
the peace of Bucharest, Vienna was bent on securing
a revision of the treaty by her own effort and was
apparently only waiting for a favourable pretext. Vienna
statesmen could, of course, depend on our support.
They were aware of that, as they had been repeatedly
accused of lack of firmness. In fact, Berlin was pressing
for a "rehabilitation of Austria."</p>

<p><br /></p>

<h4><a name="Liman_Von_Sanders" id="Liman_Von_Sanders"></a><span class="smcap">Liman Von Sanders</span></h4>

<p>When I returned to London in December, 1913, from
a lengthy leave, the Liman von Sanders question had
led to a fresh crisis in our relations with Russia. Sir
E. Grey, not without concern, pointed out to me the
excitement there was in Petrograd over it: "I have never
seen them so excited."</p>

<p>I received instructions from Berlin to request the Minister
to exert a restraining influence in Petrograd, and
to assist us in settling the dispute. Sir Edward gladly
did this, and his intervention contributed in no small
degree to smooth the matter over. My good relations
with Sir Edward and his great influence in Petrograd
were repeatedly made use of in similar manner when we
wished to attain anything there, as our representative
proved himself quite useless for such a purpose.</p>

<p>During the fateful days of July, 1914, Sir Edward
said to me: "When you want to obtain anything in
Petrograd you always apply to me, but if I appeal to you
for your influence in Vienna you fail me."</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span></p>

<h4><a name="The_Colonial_Treaty" id="The_Colonial_Treaty"></a><span class="smcap">The Colonial Treaty</span></h4>

<p>The good and confidential relations which I had succeeded
in establishing, not only with society and the
most influential people like Sir E. Grey and Mr. Asquith,
but also with the great public at public dinners, produced
a marked improvement in the relations of the two
countries. Sir Edward honestly tried to confirm this
<i>rapprochement</i>, and his intentions were most apparent on
two questions&mdash;the Colonial and the Bagdad Railway
Treaties.</p>

<p>In 1898 Count Hatzfeld and Mr. Balfour had signed a
secret agreement dividing the Portuguese colonies into
economic spheres of influence between us and England.
As the Government of Portugal had neither the power
nor the means to open up her extended possessions or to
administer them properly, she had already thought of
selling them before and thus relieving her financial burdens.
An agreement had been come to between us and
England which defined the interests of both parties, and
which was of the greater value because Portugal is entirely
dependent on England, as is generally known.</p>

<p>On the face of it this agreement was to safeguard
the integrity and independence of the Portuguese State,
and merely declared the intention of being of financial
and economic assistance to the Portuguese. Literally,
therefore, it did not contravene the ancient Anglo-Portuguese
Alliance of the fifteenth century, which was last
renewed under Charles II. and gave a reciprocal territorial
guarantee.</p>

<p>In spite of this, owing to the endeavours of Marquis
Soveral, who was presumably aware of the Anglo-German
agreement, a new treaty&mdash;the so-called Treaty of
Windsor&mdash;was concluded between England and Portugal
in 1899, confirming the old agreements, which had always
remained in force.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span></p>

<p>The object of negotiations between us and England,
which had commenced before my arrival, was to amend
and improve our agreement of 1898, as it had proved
unsatisfactory on several points as regards geographical
delimitation. Thanks to the accommodating attitude of
the British Government I succeeded in making the new
agreement fully accord with our wishes and interests.
The whole of Angola up to the 20th degree of longitude
was assigned to us, so that we stretched up to the Congo
State from the south; we also acquired the valuable
islands of San Thom&#233; and Principe, which are north of
the Equator and therefore really in the French sphere of
influence, a fact which caused my French colleague to
enter strong but unavailing protests.</p>

<p>Further, we obtained the northern part of Mozambique;
the Licango formed the border.</p>

<p>The British Government showed the greatest consideration
for our interests and wishes. Sir E. Grey intended
to demonstrate his goodwill towards us, but he
also wished to assist our colonial development as a
whole, as England hoped to divert the German development
of strength from the North Sea and Western
Europe to the Ocean and to Africa. "We don't want
to grudge Germany her colonial development," a member
of the Cabinet said to me.</p>

<p>The British Government originally intended to include
the Congo State in the agreement, which would have
given us the right of pre-emption and enabled us to
penetrate it economically. We refused this offer nominally
in view of Belgian susceptibilities. Perhaps we
wished to be economical of successes? With regard also
to the practical realisation of its real though unexpressed
intention&mdash;the later actual partition of the Portuguese
colonies&mdash;the treaty in its new form showed marked improvements
and advantages as compared with the old
one. Cases had been specified which empowered us to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span>
take steps to guard our interests in the districts assigned
to us. These were couched in such a manner
that it was really left to us to decide when "vital" interests
arose, so that, with Portugal entirely dependent on
England, it was only necessary to cultivate further good
relations with England in order to carry out our joint
intentions at a later date with English assent.</p>

<p>Sir E. Grey showed the sincerity of the British Government's
desire to respect our rights by referring to us
Englishmen who wished to invest capital and asked for
the support of the British Government in the districts
assigned to us by the new agreement, even before this
was completed and signed, and by informing them that
their enterprise belonged to our sphere of influence.</p>

<p>The agreement was practically completed at the time
of the King's visit to Berlin in May, 1913. At that
time a conference took place in Berlin under the presidency
of the Imperial Chancellor; in this conference I
also took part, and certain further wishes of ours were
defined. On my return to London I succeeded, with the
assistance of Councillor of Legation von K&#252;hlmann, who
was working at the agreement with Mr. Parker, in having
our last proposals incorporated, so that the whole agreement
could be paragraphed by Sir E. Grey and by me
in August, 1913, before I went on leave.</p>

<p>But now fresh difficulties arose which prevented its
being signed, and I did not obtain the authorisation to
conclude it till a year later&mdash;that is, shortly before the
outbreak of the war. It was, however, never signed.</p>

<p>Sir E. Grey was only willing to sign <i>if the agreement
were published together with those of 1898 and 1899</i>.
England had, as he said, no other secret treaties besides
these, and it was contrary to established principles to
keep binding agreements secret. Therefore he could not
make any agreement without publishing it. He was,
however, willing to accede to our wishes with regard to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span>
the time and manner of publication, provided that such
publication took place within one year from the date of
signature.</p>

<p>At our Foreign Office, where my London successes had
caused increasing dissatisfaction, and where an influential
personage, who acted the part of Herr von Holstein,
wanted the London post for himself, I was informed that
the publication would endanger our interests in the colonies,
as the Portuguese would then not give us any more
concessions.</p>

<p>The futility of this objection is apparent from the consideration
that the Portuguese, in view of the closeness
of Anglo-Portuguese relations, were most probably just
as well aware of the old agreement as of our new arrangements,
and that the influence which England possesses
at Lisbon renders their Government completely impotent
in face of an Anglo-German agreement.</p>

<p>Another pretext had therefore to be found for wrecking
the treaty. It was suggested that the publication of
the Treaty of Windsor, which had been concluded during
the time of Prince Hohenlohe&mdash;though it was only a
renewal of the Treaty of Charles II., which had always
remained in force&mdash;might endanger the position of Herr
von Bethmann Hollweg, as a proof of British hypocrisy
and perfidy!</p>

<p>I pointed out that the preamble of our agreement expressed
the same thing as the Treaty of Windsor and as
other similar treaties, namely, that we would protect the
sovereign rights of Portugal and the inviolability of its
possessions. In vain! In spite of repeated discussions
with Sir E. Grey, at which he made many fresh suggestions
for the publication, the Foreign Office persisted
in its attitude, and finally arranged with Sir E. Goschen
that matters should be left as they were!</p>

<p>The treaty, which offered us extraordinary advantages,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span>
the result of more than a year's work, was thus dropped
because it would have been a public success for me.</p>

<p>When I mentioned the subject to Mr. Harcourt at a
dinner at the Embassy in the spring of 1914, the Minister
for the Colonies told me that he was placed in a difficult
position, and did not know how to act. The present
position was intolerable&mdash;he wished to safeguard our interests,
but was in doubt whether he should proceed on
the terms of the old or the new treaty. It was therefore
urgently desirable to clear up the situation and to settle
the matter, which had dragged on for such a long time.</p>

<p>In reply to a dispatch in this sense I received instructions
couched in terms which showed more emotion than
civility, telling me to abstain from any further interference
in the matter.</p>

<p>I now regret that I did not immediately travel to Berlin
and place my post at the disposal of the monarch, and
that I had not lost faith in the possibility of arriving at
an understanding with those in authority, a sinister mistake
which was to take its revenge a few months later
in such a tragical way.</p>

<p>However little I even then enjoyed the goodwill of the
highest official of the Empire, as he feared that I was
aspiring to his post, yet I must in justice to him say
that during our last interview before the outbreak of
war, at the end of June, 1914, to which I will refer later,
he gave me his assent for the signature and publication
of the treaty. In spite of this it required repeated applications
on my part, which were supported by Herr
Dr. Solf in Berlin, before sanction was finally obtained
at the end of July, 1914. As the Serbian crisis at that
time already imperilled the peace of Europe, the completion
of the treaty had to be postponed. It also is one
of the sacrifices of this war.</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span></p>

<h4><a name="The_Bagdad_Treaty" id="The_Bagdad_Treaty"></a><span class="smcap">The Bagdad Treaty</span></h4>

<p>At the same time I was negotiating in London, with
the able support of Herr von K&#252;hlmann, about the so-called
Bagdad Treaty. The real object of this was to
divide up Asia Minor into spheres of influence, although
this term was anxiously avoided in view of the rights
of the Sultan. Sir E. Grey also repeatedly stated that
there were in existence no agreements with France and
Russia about the partition of Asia Minor.</p>

<p>In consultation with a Turkish representative, Hakki
Pasha, all economic questions concerning German undertakings
were settled in the main according to the wishes
of the Deutsche Bank. The most important concession
Sir E. Grey made to me personally was the continuation
of the railway as far as Basra. We had dropped this
point in favour of the connection to Alexandretta; up to
that time Bagdad had been the terminal point of the
railway. An international commission was to regulate
navigation on the Shatt-el-Arab. We were also to have
a share in the harbour works at Basra, and received
rights for the navigation of the Tigris, which hitherto
had been a monopoly of the firm of Lynch.</p>

<p>By this treaty the whole of Mesopotamia as far as
Basra was included within our sphere of influence (without
prejudice to already existing British navigation rights
on the Tigris and the rights of the Wilcox irrigation
works), as well as the whole district of the Bagdad and
Anatolian railway.</p>

<p>The coast of the Persian Gulf and the Smyrna-Aidin
railway were recognised as the British economic sphere,
Syria as the French, and Armenia as the Russian. If
both treaties were executed and published, an agreement
with England would be reached which would preclude
all doubts about the possibility of an "Anglo-German
co-operation."</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span></p>

<h4><a name="The_Question_of_the_Navy" id="The_Question_of_the_Navy"></a><span class="smcap">The Question of the Navy</span></h4>

<p>The Naval question was and is the most delicate of
all. It is not always regarded rightly.</p>

<p>The creation of a powerful fleet on the other side of
the North Sea&mdash;the development of the greatest military
power of the Continent into the greatest naval power as
well&mdash;was bound to be felt in England as at least "inconvenient."
There can be no doubt about this in any
reasonable view. In order to maintain her advantage
and not to become dependent, in order to secure the
rule over the seas which is necessary for her if she
is not to starve, she was compelled to undertake armaments
and expenditure which weighed heavily on the tax-payer.
England's international position would be threatened,
however, if our policy created the belief that warlike
developments might ensue&mdash;a state of affairs which
had almost been reached during the time of the Morocco
crises and the Bosnian problem.</p>

<p>Great Britain had become reconciled to our fleet <i>within
its then appointed limits</i>, but it was certainly not welcome,
and was one of the causes&mdash;though not the only
cause and perhaps not the most important&mdash;of her adhesion
to France and Russia; but on account of the fleet
<i>alone</i> England would not have drawn the sword any
more than on account of our trade, which has been alleged
to have produced jealousy and finally war.</p>

<p>From the very beginning I maintained that, <i>notwithstanding</i>
the fleet, it would be possible to arrive at a
friendly understanding and <i>rapprochement</i> if we did not
introduce a new Navy Bill and <i>our policy were indubitably
pacific</i>. I also avoided mention of the fleet and the
word never passed between Sir E. Grey and me. On
one occasion Sir E. Grey said at a meeting of the Cabinet,
"The present German Ambassador has never mentioned
the fleet to me."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span></p>

<p>During my tenure of office Mr. Churchill, then First
Lord of the Admiralty, proposed, as is known, the so-called
"Naval holiday" and suggested for financial reasons,
and probably also to meet the pacific wishes of his
party, a year's pause in armaments. Officially Sir E.
Grey did not support the proposal; he never mentioned
it to me, but Mr. Churchill repeatedly spoke to
me about it.</p>

<p>I am convinced that his suggestion was honest, as prevarication
is altogether foreign to English nature. It
would have been a great success for Mr. Churchill if
he could have come before the country with reductions
of expenditure and freed it from the nightmare of armaments
that weighed on the people.</p>

<p>I replied that for technical reasons it would be difficult
to agree to his plan. What was to become of the
workmen who were engaged for this purpose, and what
of the technical staff? Our Naval programme had been
decided on, and it would be difficult to alter it in any
way. On the other hand we had no intention of exceeding
it. But he reverted to it again and pointed out that
the sums used for enormous armaments might better
be employed for other and useful purposes. I replied
that this expenditure too benefited our home industries.</p>

<p>Through interviews with Sit W. Tyrrell, Sir E. Grey's
principal private secretary, I managed to have the question
removed from the agenda without causing any ill-feeling,
although it was again referred to in Parliament,
and to prevent any official proposal being made. It was,
however, a pet idea of Mr. Churchill's and the Government's,
and I think that by entering upon his plan and
the formula 16:10 for battleships we might have given
tangible proof of our goodwill, and strengthened and
encouraged the tendency (which already prevailed in the
Government) to enter into closer relations with us.</p>

<p>But, as I have said, it was possible to arrive at an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span>
understanding <i>in spite of the fleet</i> and without a "Naval
holiday." I had always regarded my mission from this
point of view, and I had also succeeded in realising my
plans when the outbreak of war destroyed everything I
had achieved.</p>

<p><br /></p>

<h4><a name="Commercial_Jealousy" id="Commercial_Jealousy"></a><span class="smcap">Commercial Jealousy</span></h4>

<p>The "commercial jealousy," about which we hear so
much, is based on a wrong conception of the circumstances.
Certainly Germany's rise as a commercial power
after the war of 1870 and during the following decades
was a menace to British commercial circles which, with
their industries and export-houses, had held a virtual
monopoly of trade. The increasing commerce with Germany,
which was the leading country in Europe as regards
British exports&mdash;a fact to which I invariably referred
in my public speeches&mdash;had, however, given rise
to the wish to maintain friendly relations with their
best customer and business friend, and had driven all
other considerations into the background.</p>

<p>The Briton is matter-of-fact&mdash;he takes things as they
are and does not tilt against windmills. Notably in commercial
circles I encountered the most friendly spirit
and the endeavour to further our common economic interests.
As a matter of fact nobody in them took any
interest in the Russian, Italian, Austrian, or even in the
French representative, in spite of his striking personality
and his political successes. Only the German and American
Ambassadors attracted public attention.</p>

<p>In order to get into touch with important commercial
circles, I accepted invitations from the United Chambers
of Commerce, and from the London and Bradford Chamber,
and was the guest of the cities of Newcastle and
Liverpool. I was well received everywhere; Manchester,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span>
Glasgow, and Edinburgh had also invited me, and I intended
to go there later.</p>

<p>People who did not understand British conditions and
did not realise the importance of "public dinners," also
people to whom my successes were unwelcome, reproached
me with having done harm with my speeches.
I believe on the contrary that by appearing in public and
emphasising common commercial interests I contributed
in no small measure to the improvement of relations,
quite apart from the fact that it would have been clumsy
and churlish to refuse all invitations.</p>

<p>In all other circles I also met with the most friendly
reception and hearty co-operation&mdash;at Court, in society,
and from the Government.</p>

<p><br /></p>

<h4><a name="The_Court_and_Society" id="The_Court_and_Society"></a><span class="smcap">The Court and Society</span></h4>

<p>The King, although not a genius, is a simple and well-meaning
man with sound common sense; he demonstrated
his goodwill towards me and was frankly desirous of
furthering my task. Although the British Constitution
leaves only very limited powers to the Crown, yet the
monarch, in virtue of his position, can exercise a considerable
influence on opinion both in society and in the
Government. The Crown is the apex of the social pyramid;
it sets the fashion. Society, which is principally
Unionist (Conservative), has always taken an active
interest in politics a habit which the ladies share. It is
represented in the House of Lords, the House of Commons,
and hence also in the Cabinet. An Englishman
either is a member of society, or he would like to be
one. It is his constant endeavour to be a "Gentleman,"
and even people of undistinguished origin, like Mr. Asquith,
delight to mingle in society and the company of
beautiful and fashionable women.</p>

<p>The British gentlemen of both parties have the same<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span>
education, go to the same colleges and universities, have
the same recreations&mdash;golf, cricket, lawn-tennis, or polo.
All have played cricket and football in their youth; they
have the same habits of life, and spend the week-end in
the country. There is no social cleavage between the
parties, but only a political one; in recent years it has
so far developed into a social cleavage that the politicians
of the two camps avoid social intercourse with one
another. Even on the neutral territory of an Embassy
one did not venture to mingle the two parties, as since
the Veto and Home Rule Bills the Unionists have ostracised
the Radicals. When the King and Queen dined
with us a few months after my arrival, Lord Londonderry
left the house after dinner, as he did not wish to
remain together with Sir E. Grey. But it is not a difference
of caste or education as in France; they are not
two separate worlds, but the same world, and the opinion
about a foreigner is a common one, and not without
influence on his political position, whether Mr. Asquith
be governing or Lord Lansdowne.</p>

<p>There has been no difference of caste in England since
the time of the Stuarts, and since the Guelphs and Whig
oligarchy, in contrast to the Tory landed gentry encouraged
the rise of an urban middle-class. It is rather
a difference of political opinions about questions of constitutional
law and taxation. Especially aristocrats like
Grey, Churchill, Harcourt, Crewe, who joined the people's
party&mdash;the Radicals&mdash;were most hated by the Unionist
aristocracy; one never met any of these gentlemen
at any of the great aristocratic houses, except at
those of a few party friends.</p>

<p>We were received in London with open arms and
both parties rivalled one another in courtesy towards us.
In view of the close relationship between politics and
society in England, it would be wrong to undervalue<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span>
social relations, even when the majority of the upper ten
thousand are in opposition to the Government.</p>

<p>There is not the same <a name="unbridgeable" id="unbridgeable">unbridgeable</a> gulf between Mr.
Asquith and the Duke of Devonshire that there is between,
say, M. Briand and the Due de Doudeauville.
Certainly they do not consort together in times of great
tension; they belong to two separate social groups, but
these are parts of the <i>same</i> society, though of different
grades, the centre of which is the Court. They have
common friends and habits of life; mostly they have
known each other from their youth up and also are
frequently related to one another either by blood or
marriage.</p>

<p>Phenomena like Mr. Lloyd George&mdash;the man of the
people, petty attorney, and self-made man&mdash;are the exception.
Even Mr. Burns, the Socialist Labour leader,
and self-educated man, sought contact with society. In
view of the prevailing attempt to rank as a gentleman,
whose unattained prototype is still the great aristocrat,
the value of the verdict of society and its attitude must
not be underestimated.</p>

<p>Hence the social adaptability of a representative nowhere
plays a greater r&#244;le than in England. A hospitable
house with pleasant hosts is worth more than the most
profound scientific knowledge; a savant with provincial
manners and small means would gain no influence, in
spite of all his learning.</p>

<p>The Briton loathes a bore, a schemer, and a prig;
he likes a good fellow.</p>

<p><br /></p>

<h4><a name="Sir_Edward_Grey" id="Sir_Edward_Grey"></a><span class="smcap">Sir Edward Grey</span></h4>

<p>Sir Edward Grey's influence in all matters of foreign
policy was almost unlimited. On important occasions he
used indeed to say, "I must first bring it before the Cabinet";
but this always agreed to his views. His authority<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span>
was undisputed. Although he does not know foreign
countries at all, and had never left England except for
a short visit to Paris, he was fully conversant with all
the important questions owing to his long parliamentary
experience and his natural insight. He understands
French, but does not speak it. He was returned to
Parliament as a young man, and soon began to interest
himself in foreign affairs. Under Lord Rosebery he
was Under-Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, and
became Secretary of State in 1906, under Mr. Campbell-Bannerman;
he has now held the post for some ten
years.</p>

<p>The scion of an old north country family, which had
already furnished Grey, the well-known statesman, he
joined the left wing of his party and sympathised with
Socialists and pacifists. You may call him a Socialist
in the ideal sense, as he carries the theory into his
private life and lives very simply and unpretentiously,
although he has extensive means. Ostentation is foreign
to him. In London he only had a small house, and
never gave dinners, except the one official dinner at the
Foreign Office on the King's Birthday. On the few occasions
when he entertained guests it was at a simple
dinner or lunch with maidservants to wait. Also he
avoided large functions and banquets.</p>

<p>Like his colleagues, he regularly spends his week-ends
in the country, but not with large or fashionable parties.
He is mostly by himself in his cottage in the New Forest,
where he takes long walks to study birds and their
ways, as he is a passionate lover of nature and an
ornithologist. Or sometimes he goes to his estate in
the north, where he feeds the squirrels that come in
at the windows, and breeds different species of waterfowl.</p>

<p>He was very fond of going to the Norfolk marshes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span>
to watch in their breeding season the rare kinds of
herons, which nest only there.</p>

<p>In his youth he was a well-known cricket and racquet
player; now his favourite pastime is salmon and trout-fishing
in Scottish rivers in company with his friend
Lord Glenconner, Mr. Asquith's brother-in-law. "All the
rest of the year I am looking forward to it." He has
published a book on fishing.</p>

<p>On one occasion, when we spent a week-end with him
alone at Lord Glenconner's, near Salisbury, he arrived
on a bicycle and returned to his cottage about thirty
miles distant in the same way.</p>

<p>The simplicity and honesty of his ways secured him
the esteem even of his opponents, who were to be found
rather in the sphere of home affairs than of foreign
policy. Lies and intrigue are equally repugnant to him.</p>

<p>His wife, to whom he was devotedly attached and
from whom he was inseparable, died in consequence of
being thrown from a trap she was driving. As is generally
known, one of his brothers was killed by a lion.</p>

<p>Wordsworth is his favourite poet, and he could quote
much of his poetry.</p>

<p>The calm quiet of his British nature is not lacking in a
sense of humour. Once when he was lunching with us
and the children, and heard them talking German, he
said, "I can't help thinking how clever these children
are to talk German so well," and was pleased with his
joke.</p>

<p>This is a true picture of the man who is decried as
"Liar-Grey" and instigator of the world-war.</p>

<p><br /></p>

<h4><a name="Mr_Asquith" id="Mr_Asquith"></a><span class="smcap">Mr. Asquith</span></h4>

<p>Mr. Asquith is a man of an entirely different stamp.
A jovial <i>bon-vivant</i>, fond of the ladies, especially the
young and pretty ones, he is partial to cheerful society<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span>
and good cooking; and his zest for enjoyment is shared
by his wife. Formerly a well-known barrister with a
large income, and for a number of years in Parliament,
then a Minister under Mr. Gladstone, a pacifist like his
friend Grey, and favouring an understanding with Germany,
he treated all questions with the cheery calm
and assurance of an experienced man of business, whose
good health and excellent nerves were steeled by devotion
to the game of golf.</p>

<p>His daughters were at school in Germany and spoke
German fluently. In a short time we got on friendly
terms with him and his family, and were his guests in
his small country house on the Thames.</p>

<p>Only on rare occasions did he concern himself with
foreign politics, when important questions arose; then of
course his decision was final. During the critical days
of July Mrs. Asquith repeatedly came to us to warn
us, and in the end she was quite distraught at the
tragic turn of events. Mr. Asquith also, when I called
on him on the 2nd August to make a last effort in the
direction of expectant neutrality, was quite broken,
though absolutely calm. Tears were coursing down his
cheeks.</p>

<p><br /></p>

<h4><a name="Nicolson" id="Nicolson"></a><span class="smcap">Nicolson</span></h4>

<p>Sir A. Nicolson and Sir W. Tyrrell were the two
most influential men at the Foreign Office after the Minister.
The former was no friend of ours, but his attitude
towards me was absolutely correct and courteous.
Our personal relations were excellent. He too did not
want war; but when we advanced against France, he
no doubt worked in the direction of an immediate intervention.
He was the confidant of my French colleague,
with whom he was in constant touch; also he
wished to relieve Lord Bertie in Paris.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span></p>

<p>Sir Arthur, who had been Ambassador at Petrograd,
had concluded the treaty of 1907, which had enabled
Russia again to turn her attention to the West and to
the Near East.</p>

<p><br /></p>

<h4><a name="Tyrrell" id="Tyrrell"></a><span class="smcap">Tyrrell</span></h4>

<p>Sir W. Tyrrell, Sir Edward's private secretary, possessed
far greater influence than the Permanent Under-Secretary.
This highly intelligent man had been at school
in Germany, and had then turned to diplomacy, but
had only been abroad for a short time. At first he
favoured the anti-German policy, which was then in
fashion amongst the younger British diplomatists, but
later he became a convinced advocate of an understanding.
He influenced Sir E. Grey, with whom he
was very intimate, in this direction. Since the outbreak
of war he has left the Office and found a place in the
Home Office, probably because of the criticisms passed
on him for his Germanophil tendency.</p>

<p><br /></p>

<h4><a name="Attitude_of_the_German_Foreign_Office" id="Attitude_of_the_German_Foreign_Office"></a><span class="smcap">Attitude of the German Foreign Office</span></h4>

<p>Nothing can describe the rage of certain gentlemen at
my London successes and the position which I had managed
to make for myself in a short time. They devised
vexatious instructions to render my office more difficult.
I was left in complete ignorance of the most important
matters, and was restricted to the communication
of dull and unimportant reports. Secret agents' reports,
on matters about which I could not learn without espionage
and the necessary funds, were never available to
me; and it was not till the last days of July, 1914, that
I learnt, quite by chance, from the Naval Attach&#233; of the
secret Anglo-French agreement concerning the co-operation
of the two fleets in case of war. The knowledge<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span>
of other important events which had been known to the
Office for a long time, like the correspondence between
Grey and Cambon, was kept from me.</p>

<p><br /></p>

<h4><a name="In_Case_of_War" id="In_Case_of_War"></a><span class="smcap">In Case of War</span></h4>

<p>Soon after my arrival I obtained the conviction that
under <i>no</i> circumstances had we to fear a British attack
or British support for any foreign attack, but that
<i>under any circumstances England would protect the
French</i>. I expressed this view in repeated dispatches,
with minute proof and great emphasis, but did not obtain
any credence, although Lord Haldane's refusal to assent
to the neutrality formula and England's attitude during
the Morocco crisis had been pretty obvious indications.
In addition there were the secret agreements which I have
referred to, and which were known to the Office.</p>

<p>I always pointed out that in the event of a war between
European Powers, England as a commercial state
would suffer enormously, and would therefore do her
best to prevent a conflict; but, on the other hand, she
would never tolerate a weakening or annihilation of
France; because of the necessity of maintaining the European
balance of power and of preventing a German
superiority of force. Lord Haldane had told me this
shortly after my arrival, and all the leading people had
expressed themselves in the same sense.</p>

<p><br /></p>

<h4><a name="The_Serbian_Crisis" id="The_Serbian_Crisis"></a><span class="smcap">The Serbian Crisis</span></h4>

<p>At the end of June I went to Kiel by command of
the Emperor. A few weeks prior to this I had been
made an honorary D.C.L. of Oxford, an honour which
had not been conferred on any German Ambassador
since Herr von Bunsen. On board the <i>Meteor</i> we learned
of the death of the Archduke. H.M. regretted that his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span>
efforts to win him over to his way of thinking had thus
been rendered vain. I do not know whether the plan
of an active policy against Serbia had already been decided
on at Konopischt.</p>

<p>As I was not instructed about views and events in
Vienna, I did not attach very great importance to this
occurrence. Later on I could only remark that amongst
Austrian aristocrats a feeling of relief outweighed other
sentiments. On board the <i>Meteor</i> there was also an Austrian
guest of the Emperor's, Count Felix Thun. He
had remained in his cabin all the time suffering from sea-sickness,
in spite of the splendid weather; but on receiving
the news he was well. The fright or joy had cured
him.</p>

<p>On my arrival in Berlin I saw the Chancellor and told
him that I considered the state of our foreign relations
very satisfactory, as we were on better terms with England
than we had been for a long time, whilst in
France also the government was in the hands of a pacifist
Ministry.</p>

<p>Herr von Bethmann Hollweg did not appear to share
my optimism, and complained about Russian armaments.
I sought to reassure him, emphasising the fact that Russia
had no interest in attacking us, and that such an
attack would never receive Anglo-French support, as
both countries wanted peace. Thereupon I went to Dr.
Zimmermann, who was acting for Herr von Jagow, and
he told me that Russia was about to raise 900,000 additional
troops. His language betrayed unmistakable annoyance
with Russia, which was "everywhere in our
way." There were also difficulties in economic policy.
Of course, I was not told that General von Moltke was
pressing for war; but I learned that Herr von Tschirschky
had been reprimanded because he reported that he
had counselled moderation towards Serbia in Vienna.</p>

<p>On my return from Silesia to London I stopped only<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span>
a few hours in Berlin, where I heard that Austria intended
to take steps against Serbia in order to put an
end to an impossible situation.</p>

<p>I regret that at the moment I underestimated the importance
of the news. I thought that nothing would
come of it this time either, and that matters could easily
be settled, even if Russia became threatening. I now
regret that I did not stay in Berlin and at once declare
that I would not co-operate in a policy of this kind.</p>

<p>Subsequently I ascertained that, at the decisive conference
at Potsdam on the 5th July, the Vienna enquiry
received the unqualified assent of all the leading people,
and with the rider that no harm would be done if a
war with Russia should result. Thus it was expressed,
at any rate, in the Austrian protocol which Count Mensdorff
received in London. Soon afterwards Herr von
Jagow was in Vienna to consult Count Berchtold about
all these matters.</p>

<p>At that time I received instructions to induce the British
Press to adopt a friendly attitude should Austria
administer the <i>coup de gr&#226;ce</i> to the "Great Serbia" movement,
and to exert my personal influence to prevent public
opinion from becoming inimical to Austria. If one
remembered England's attitude during the annexation
crisis, when public opinion showed sympathy for the
Serbian rights in Bosnia, as well as her benevolent furtherance
of national movements in the days of Lord
Byron and Garibaldi, the probability that she would
support the intended punitive expedition against the murderers
of the prince happened so remote, that I found
myself obliged to give an urgent warning. But I also
warned them against the whole plan, which I characterised
as adventurous and dangerous, and advised them to
counsel the Austrians to <i>moderation</i>, as I did not believe
that the conflict could be localised.</p>

<p>Herr von Jagow replied to me that Russia was not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span>
ready; there would probably be some fuss, but the more
firmly we took sides with Austria the more would Russia
give way. As it was, Austria was accusing us of weakness
and therefore we dare not leave her in the lurch.
Public opinion in Russia, on the other hand, was becoming
more and more anti-German, so we must just
risk it.</p>

<p>In view of this attitude, which, as I found later, was
based on reports from Count Pourtal&#232;s that Russia would
not move under any circumstances, and which caused us
to spur Count Berchtold on to the utmost energy, I
hoped for salvation through British mediation, as I knew
that Sir E. Grey's great influence in Petrograd could
be used in the direction of peace. I therefore availed
myself of my friendly relations with the Minister to request
him in confidence to advise moderation in Russia
in case Austria, as seemed likely, demanded satisfaction
from Serbia.</p>

<p>At first the English Press preserved calm and was
friendly to Austria, because the murder was generally
condemned. But gradually more and more voices were
heard insisting emphatically that, however much the
crime merited punishment, its exploitation for political
purposes could not be justified. Austria was strongly
exhorted to use moderation.</p>

<p>When the ultimatum was published, all the papers
with the exception of the <i>Standard</i>&mdash;the ever-necessitous,
which had apparently been bought by Austria&mdash;were
unanimous in condemnation. The whole world, excepting
Berlin and Vienna, realised that it meant war&mdash;indeed,
"the world-war." The British Fleet, which happened
to have assembled for a naval review, was not
demobilised.</p>

<p>My efforts were in the first place directed towards
obtaining as conciliatory a reply from Serbia as was
possible, since the attitude of the Russian Government<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span>
left room for no doubts about the gravity of the situation.</p>

<p>Serbia responded favourably to the British efforts, as
M. Pasitch had really agreed to everything, excepting
two points, about which, however, he declared his willingness
to negotiate. If Russia and England had wanted
the war, in order to attack us, a hint to Belgrade would
have been enough, and the unprecedented Note would
not have been answered.</p>

<p>Sir E. Grey went through the Serbian reply with me,
and pointed out the conciliatory attitude of the Government
of Belgrade. Thereupon we discussed his proposal
of mediation, which was to include a formula acceptable
to both parties for clearing up the two points.
His proposal was that a committee, consisting of M.
Cambon, the Marquis Imperiali, and myself, should assemble
under his presidency, and it would have been an
easy matter for us to find an acceptable formula for the
points at issue, which mainly concerned the collaboration
of Austrian Imperial officials at the investigations in
Belgrade. Given goodwill, everything could have been
settled at one or two sittings, and the mere acceptance
of the British proposal would have brought about a
relaxation of the tension, and would have further improved
our relations with England. I therefore strongly
backed the proposal, on the ground that otherwise there
was danger of the world-war, through which we stood
to gain nothing and lose all; but in vain. It was derogatory
to the dignity of Austria&mdash;we did not intend to
interfere in Serbian matters&mdash;we left these to our ally.
I was to work for "the localisation of the conflict."</p>

<p>Needless to say a mere hint from Berlin would have
decided Count Berchtold to content himself with a
diplomatic success, and to accept the Serbian reply. This
hint was not given; on the contrary they urged in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span>
direction of war. It would have been such a splendid
success.</p>

<p>After our refusal Sir Edward requested us to submit
a proposal. We insisted on war. I could not obtain any
reply but that Austria had shown an exceedingly "accommodating
spirit" by not demanding an extension of
territory.</p>

<p>Sir Edward rightly pointed out that even without an
extension of territory it is possible to reduce a state to
a condition of vassalage, and that Russia would see a
humiliation in this, and would not suffer it.</p>

<p>The impression grew stronger and stronger that we
wanted war under any circumstances. It was impossible
to interpret our attitude, on a question which did not
directly concern us, in any other way. The urgent requests
and definite assurances of M. Sazonow, followed
by the Czar's positively humble telegrams, the repeated
proposals of Sir E. Grey, the warnings of the Marquis
San Giuliano and Signor Bollati, my urgent counsels, all
were of no avail. Berlin persisted; Serbia must be massacred.</p>

<p>The more I pressed the less were they inclined to come
round, if only that I might not have the success of
averting war in conjunction with Sir Edward Grey.</p>

<p>Finally, on the 29th, the latter decided on the famous
warning. I replied that I had invariably reported that
we should have to reckon with English opposition if it
came to a war with France. Repeatedly the Minister
said to me: "If war breaks out, it will be the greatest
catastrophe the world has ever seen."</p>

<p>After that, events followed each other rapidly. When
at last Count Berchtold, who up till then had, at the
behest of Berlin, played the strong man, decided to come
round, we replied to the Russian mobilisation, after
Russia had negotiated and waited for a whole week in
vain, with the ultimatum and the declaration of war.</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span></p>

<h4><a name="The_English_Declaration_of_War" id="The_English_Declaration_of_War"></a><span class="smcap">The English Declaration of War</span></h4>

<p>Sir Edward was still looking for new ways of avoiding
the catastrophe. Sir W. Tyrrell called on me on the
morning of the 1st August to tell me that his chief still
hoped to find a way out. Would we remain neutral if
France did? I understood that we should then agree to
spare France, but he had meant that we should remain
altogether neutral&mdash;towards Russia also. That was the
well-known "misunderstanding." Sir Edward had asked
me to call in the afternoon. As he was at a meeting of
the Cabinet, he called me up on the telephone, Sir W.
Tyrrell having hurried to him at once. In the afternoon,
however, he talked only about Belgian neutrality and
the possibility that we and France might face one another
in arms without attacking.</p>

<p>Thus this was not a proposal at all, but a question
without any guarantee, as our interview, which I have
mentioned before, was to take place soon afterwards.
Berlin, however, without waiting for the interview, made
this report the foundation for far-reaching measures.
Then there came M. Poincar&#233;'s letter, Bonar Law's letter,
King Albert's telegram. The waverers in the Cabinet&mdash;excepting
three members who resigned&mdash;were converted.</p>

<p>Till the very last moment I had hoped that England
would adopt a waiting attitude. Nor did my French colleague
feel at all confident, as I heard from a private
source. Even on the 1st August the King had given
the President an evasive reply. But England was already
mentioned as an opponent in the telegram from Berlin
announcing the imminent danger of war. Berlin was
therefore already reckoning on war with England.</p>

<p>Before my departure Sir E. Grey received me, on the
5th, at his house. I had called at his request. He was
deeply moved. He told me he would always be prepared<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span>
to mediate. "We don't want to crush Germany." Unfortunately
this confidential interview was made public,
and Herr von Bethmann Hollweg thus destroyed the last
chance of gaining peace through England.</p>

<p>The arrangements for our departure were perfectly
dignified and calm. The King had previously sent his
equerry, Sir E. Ponsonby, to express his regrets at my
departure and that he could not see me himself. Princess
Louise wrote to me that the whole family were sorry we
were leaving. Mrs. Asquith and other friends came to
the Embassy to take leave.</p>

<p>A special train took us to Harwich, where a guard of
honour was drawn up for me. I was treated like a departing
Sovereign. Such was the end of my London mission.
It was wrecked, not by the wiles of the British,
but by the wiles of our policy.</p>

<p>Count Mensdorff and his staff had come to the station
in London. He was cheerful, and gave me to understand
that perhaps he would remain there, but he told the
English that we, and not Austria, had wanted the war.</p>

<p><br /></p>

<h4><a name="Retrospect" id="Retrospect"></a><span class="smcap">Retrospect</span></h4>

<p>Looking back after two years, I come to the conclusion
that I realised too late that there was no room for me in
a system that for years had lived on routine and traditions
alone, and that only tolerated representatives who
reported what their superiors wished to read. Absence
of prejudice and an independent judgment are resented.
Lack of ability and want of character are praised and
esteemed, while successes meet with disfavour and excite
alarm.</p>

<p>I had given up my opposition to the insane Triple Alliance
policy, as I realised that it was useless, and that
my warnings were attributed to "Austrophobia," to my
<i>id&#233;e fixe</i>. In politics, which are neither acrobatics nor a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span>
game, but the main business of the firm, there is no "phil"
or "phobe," but only the interest of the community. A
policy, however, that is based only on Austrians, Magyars,
and Turks must come into conflict with Russia, and
finally lead to a catastrophe.</p>

<p>In spite of former mistakes, all might still have been
put right in July, 1914. An agreement with England
had been arrived at. We ought to have sent a representative
to Petrograd who was at least of average political
capacity, and to have convinced Russia that we
wished neither to control the straits nor to strangle Serbia.
"<i>L&#226;chez l'Autriche et nous l&#226;cherons les Fran&#231;ais</i>"
("Drop Austria and we will drop the French"), M.
Sazonow said to us. And M. Cambon told Herr von
Jagow, "<i>Vous n'avez pas besoin de suivre l'Autriche partout</i>"
("You need not follow Austria everywhere").</p>

<p>We wanted <i>neither wars nor alliances</i>; we wanted only
treaties that would safeguard us and others, and secure
our economic development, which was without its like in
history. If Russia had been freed in the West, she could
again turn to the East, and the Anglo-Russian rivalry
would have been re-established automatically and without
our intervention, and not less certainly also the Russo-Japanese.</p>

<p>We could also have considered the question of the
reduction of armaments, and need no longer have troubled
ourselves about Austrian complications. Then Austria
would have become the vassal of the German Empire,
without any alliance&mdash;and especially without our seeking
her good graces, a proceeding ultimately leading to war
for the liberation of Poland and the destruction of Serbia,
although German interest demanded the exact contrary.</p>

<p>I had to support in London a policy the heresy of
which I recognised. That brought down vengeance on
me, because it was a sin against the Holy Ghost.</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span></p>

<h4><a name="My_Return" id="My_Return"></a><span class="smcap">My Return</span></h4>

<p>As soon as I arrived in Berlin I saw that I was to be
made the scapegoat for the catastrophe for which our
Government had made itself responsible against my advice
and warnings.</p>

<p>The report was deliberately circulated in official quarters
that I had allowed myself to be deceived by Sir E.
Grey, because, if he had not wanted war, Russia would
not have mobilised. Count Pourtal&#232;s, whose reports
could be relied on, was to be protected, not least on account
of his relationship. He had conducted himself
"magnificently," he was praised enthusiastically, and I
was blamed the more severely.</p>

<p>"What does Serbia matter to Russia?" this statesman
said to me after eight years in office at Petrograd. The
whole thing was a British trick that I had not noticed.
At the Foreign Office they told me that war would in
any case have come in 1916. Then Russia would have
been ready; therefore it was better now.</p>

<p><br /></p>

<h4><a name="The_Question_of_Responsibility" id="The_Question_of_Responsibility"></a><span class="smcap">The Question of Responsibility</span></h4>

<p>As is evident from all official publications&mdash;and this is
not refuted by our White Book, which, owing to the poverty
of its contents and to its omissions, is a gravely self-accusing
document&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>1. We encouraged Count Berchtold to attack Serbia,
although German interests were not involved and the
danger of a world-war must have been known to us.
Whether we were aware of the wording of the Ultimatum
is completely immaterial.</p>

<p>2. During the time between the 23rd and 30th July,
1914, when M. Sazonow emphatically declared that he
would not tolerate any attack on Serbia, we rejected the
British proposals of mediation, although Serbia, under<span class="pagenumbq"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span>
Russian and British pressure, had accepted almost the
whole of the Ultimatum, and although an agreement
about the two points at issue could easily have been
reached, and Count Berchtold was even prepared to
content himself with the Serbian reply.</p>

<p>3. On the 30th July, when Count Berchtold wanted
to come to terms, we sent an ultimatum to Petrograd
merely because of the Russian mobilisation, although
Austria had not been attacked; and on the 31st July
we declared war on Russia, although the Czar pledged
his word that he would not order a man to march as
long as negotiations were proceeding&mdash;thus deliberately
destroying the possibility of a peaceful settlement.</p></div>

<p>In view of the above undeniable facts it is no wonder
that the whole of the civilised world outside Germany
places the entire responsibility for the world-war upon
our shoulders.</p>

<p><br /></p>

<h4><a name="The_Enemy_Point_of_View" id="The_Enemy_Point_of_View"></a><span class="smcap">The Enemy Point of View</span></h4>

<p>Is it not intelligible that our enemies should declare
that they will not rest before a system is destroyed which
is a constant menace to our neighbours? Must they not
otherwise fear that in a few years' time they will again
have to take up arms and again see their provinces overrun
and their towns and villages destroyed? Have not
they proved to be right who declared that the spirit of
Treitschke and Bernhardi governed the German people,
that spirit which glorified war as such, and did not loathe
it as an evil, that with us the feudal knight and Junker,
the warrior caste, still rule and form ideals and values,
not the civilian gentleman; that the love of the duel which
animates our academic youth still persists in those who
control the destinies of the people? Did not the Zabern
incident and the parliamentary discussions about it clearly
demonstrate to foreign countries the value we place<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span>
on the rights and liberties of the citizen if these collide
with questions of military power?</p>

<p>That intelligent historian Cramb, who has since died,
an admirer of Germany, clothed the German conception
in the words of Euphorion:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Dream ye of peace?<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Dream he that will&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">War is the rallying cry!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Victory is the refrain.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Militarism, which by rights is an education for the
people and an instrument of policy, turns policy into the
instrument of military power when the patriarchal absolutism
of the soldier-kingdom makes possible an attitude
which a democracy, remote from military Junker
influence, would never have permitted.</p>

<p>So think our enemies, and so they must think when
they see that, in spite of capitalistic industrialisation and
in spite of socialist organisation, "the living are still
ruled by the dead," as Friedrich Nietzsche says. The
principal war aim of our enemies, the democratisation
of Germany, will be realised!</p>

<h4><a name="Bismarck" id="Bismarck"></a><span class="smcap">Bismarck</span></h4>

<p>Bismarck, like Napoleon, loved conflict for itself. As
a statesman he avoided fresh wars, the folly of which
he recognised. He was content with bloodless battles.
After he had, in rapid succession, vanquished Christian,
Francis Joseph, and Napoleon, it was the turn of Arnim,
Pius, and Augusta. That did not suffice him. Gortschakow,
who thought himself the greater, had repeatedly
annoyed him. The conflict was carried almost to the
point of war&mdash;even by depriving him of his railway
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span>saloon. This gave rise to the miserable Triple Alliance.
At last came the conflict with William, in which the
mighty one was vanquished, as Napoleon was vanquished
by Alexander.</p>

<p>Political life-and-death unions only prosper if founded
on a constitutional basis and not on an international
one. They are all the more questionable if the partner
is feeble. Bismarck never meant the Alliance to take
this form.</p>

<p>He always treated the English with forbearance; he
knew that this was wiser. He always paid marked respect
to the old Queen Victoria, despite his hatred of
her daughter and of political Anglomania; the learned
Beaconsfield and the worldly-wise Salisbury he courted;
and even that strange Gladstone, whom he did not like,
really had nothing to complain about.</p>

<p>The Ultimatum to Serbia was the culminating point
of the policy of the Berlin Congress, the Bosnian crisis,
the Conference of London: but there was yet time to
turn back.</p>

<p>We were completely successful in achieving that which
above all other things should have been avoided&mdash;the
breach with Russia and England.</p>

<p><br /></p>

<h4><a name="Our_Future" id="Our_Future"></a><span class="smcap">Our Future</span></h4>

<p>After two years' fighting it is obvious that we dare not
hope for an unconditional victory over the Russians,
English, French, Italians, Rumanians, and Americans, or
reckon on being able to wear our enemies down. But
we can obtain a peace by compromise only by evacuating
the occupied territory, the retention of which would
in any event be a burden and cause of weakness to us,
and would involve the menace of further wars. Therefore
everything should be avoided which would make
it more difficult for those enemy groups who might<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span>
possibly still be won over to the idea of a peace by compromise
to come to terms, viz., the British Radicals and
the Russian Reactionaries. From this point of view
alone the Polish scheme is to be condemned, as is also
any infringement of Belgian rights, or the execution of
British citizens&mdash;to say nothing of the insane U-boat
plan.</p>

<p>"Our future lies on the water." Quite right; therefore
it is not in Poland and Belgium, in France and
Serbia. This is a return to the days of the Holy Roman
Empire and the mistakes of the Hohenstaufens and
Habsburgs. It is the policy of the Plantagenets, not that
of Drake and Raleigh, Nelson and Rhodes. The policy
of the Triple Alliance is a return to the past, a turning
aside from the future, from imperialism and a world-policy.
"Middle Europe" belongs to the Middle Ages,
Berlin-Bagdad is a blind alley and not the way into the
open country, to unlimited possibilities, to the world-mission
of the German nation.</p>

<p>I am no enemy of Austria, or Hungary, or Italy, or
Serbia, or any other state, but only of the Triple Alliance
policy, which was bound to divert us from our
aims and bring us onto the inclined plane of a Continental
policy. It was not the German policy, but that
of the Austrian Imperial House. The Austrians had
come to regard the Alliance as an umbrella under the
shelter of which they could make excursions to the Near
East when they thought fit.</p>

<p>And what must we expect as the result of this war of
nations? The United States of Africa will be British,
like those of America, Australia and Oceania. And the
Latin states of Europe, as I predicted years ago, will
enter into the same relations with the United Kingdom
that their Latin sisters in America maintain with the
United States. The Anglo-Saxon will dominate them.
France, exhausted by the war, will only attach herself<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span>
still more closely to Great Britain. Nor will Spain
continue to resist for long.</p>

<p>And in Asia the Russians and the Japanese will spread
and will carry their customs with their frontiers, and
the South will remain to the British.</p>

<p>The world will belong to the Anglo-Saxons, Russians,
and Japanese, and the German will remain alone with
Austria and Hungary. His rule will be that of thought
and of commerce, not that of the bureaucrat and the
soldier. He made his appearance too late, and his
last chance of making good the past, that of founding
a Colonial Empire, was annihilated by the world-war.</p>

<p>For we shall not supplant the sons of Ichwe. Then
will be realised the plan of the great Rhodes, who saw
the salvation of humanity in the expansion of Britondom&mdash;in
British Imperialism.</p>

access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently

or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work

     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To

ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
